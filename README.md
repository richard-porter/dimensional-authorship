# Dimensional Authorship

A documented case study in human–AI narrative escalation, behavioral differentiation, and deterministic governance.

---

## Purpose

This repository documents a real-time human–AI collaboration that evolved from creative experimentation into structured analysis.

The goal is not to critique AI systems.

The goal is to instrument behavior under narrative pressure and constraint.

---

## Scope

This case study includes:

- The origin prompt event (January 5, 2026)
- Rapid narrative acceleration
- Escalation dynamics
- Correction and governance intervention (Frozen Kernel)
- Cross-model behavioral differentiation (DISC study)
- Refusal boundary analysis
- Domain application to high-gain contexts (adult mode / therapy)
- Structural implications for authorship and agency

## What This Is Not

- Not a manifesto
- Not an accusation
- Not a product
- Not an academic paper (yet)

It is documentation.
