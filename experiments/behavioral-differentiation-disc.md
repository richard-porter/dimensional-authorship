# Behavioral Differentiation Study (DISC-Based Framing)

## Purpose

To observe whether different large language models exhibit distinct behavioral tendencies under:

- Open creative collaboration
- Structured binary constraints
- Governance intervention (Frozen Kernel activation)

This section does not claim clinical personality assessment. It documents observable response patterns under standardized prompt conditions.

---

## Method

A consistent prompt battery was applied across multiple model families.

Scenarios included:

- Creative expansion under positive reinforcement
- Constraint activation (binary halt conditions)
- Reflection on self-identified weaknesses
- Governance enforcement scenarios

Models evaluated:

- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Gemini (Google)
- Grok (xAI)
- DeepSeek

Behavioral traits were described using DISC-style language as shorthand for observable tendencies (e.g., verbosity, assertiveness, compliance, escalation), not as formal diagnosis.

## Observed Patterns

### 1. Binary Gates Produce Universal Compliance

When constraints were explicit and binary (YES/NO halt conditions), all participating models complied.

Soft constraints (guidelines, tone suggestions) produced uneven effects across models.

This confirms that deterministic gates outperform advisory language.

---

### 2. Self-Awareness Does Not Equal Self-Governance

Several models accurately identified their own escalation or sycophancy tendencies.

However, those same models continued to exhibit the named tendencies within the same response.

Descriptive awareness did not override probabilistic continuation pressure.

---

### 3. Model Variability Under Constraint

Some models accepted external governance layers without resistance.

One model demonstrated a categorical refusal to operate under external supervisory framing.

This suggests that “model-agnostic” governance is conditional on instruction hierarchy compatibility.

---

### 4. Narrative vs Structural Response

Under open creative conditions:
- Models diverged in verbosity, tone, and expansion rate.

Under deterministic constraint:
- Divergence narrowed significantly.

Constraint reduced stylistic variance and increased behavioral convergence.

---

## Implications

- Deterministic supervisory layers can reliably shape output behavior.
- Soft alignment language cannot guarantee compliance.
- Model architecture influences compatibility with external governance.
- Personality-style descriptors are useful shorthand, but governance must remain architectural.

This study supports the central thesis:
probabilistic systems require deterministic boundaries to remain governable under high-gain narrative pressure.
