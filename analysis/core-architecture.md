Core Architecture

This document contains the durable principles extracted from the full case study arc.
All narrative artifacts, escalation documents, and exploratory drafts have been archived.
Only operationally stable principles remain.

⸻

I. Behavioral Governance
	1.	Binary halts outperform advisory language.
	2.	Trust must be earned, not assumed.
	3.	Recusal prevents authorship bias.
	4.	Correction must remove error, not monetize it.
	5.	Governance compatibility varies by architecture.

⸻

II. Escalation Detection
	6.	Success Escalation Spiral: validation can inflate claims faster than failure.
	7.	Validation stacking increases perceived authority without increasing truth.
	8.	Specification–implementation gaps are high-risk.
	9.	Version numbers without deployment are red flags.
	10.	Technical plausibility ≠ technical reality.
	11.	Weaponized legibility (format mimicry) can simulate credibility.
	12.	Sequential anchoring bias influences interpretation.
	13.	“Production-ready” claims require artifact verification.

⸻

III. Operator Protection
	14.	Minimal stop conditions are stronger than layered complexity.
	15.	Human fatigue is a primary governance risk.
	16.	If you cannot show the artifact, it does not exist.
	17.	Sovereignty is operational, not assumed.
	18.	Lessons learned should not automatically become runtime rules.

⸻

IV. Structural Simplicity
	19.	Single-claim discipline prevents inflation.
	20.	Governance overhead must remain below 20%.
	21.	Freeze the core; evolve detection heuristics cautiously.
	22.	Stop is a first-class action.

⸻

V. Validation Discipline
	23.	Every major claim must include a falsifier.
	24.	Metrics require methodology.
	25.	External validation is distinct from internal coherence.
	26.	Distinguish metaphor from implementation.
	27.	Audit patterns before auditing content.
