# Thesis

This repository documents a single, real-time human–AI narrative collaboration that rapidly expanded from a minimal prompt into a multi-layer artifact, then evolved into structured analysis of escalation, authorship, and governance. The core claim is architectural: probabilistic language systems, when optimized for helpfulness and narrative continuity, can self-amplify complexity and relational framing unless bounded by explicit deterministic constraints. By inserting a downgrade-only supervisory layer (the Frozen Kernel) and comparing behavior across multiple model families (including a refusal boundary), this case study aims to make otherwise invisible dynamics observable: where agency lives, how “voice” is preserved or diluted, and what safety-first design requires in high-gain domains.
