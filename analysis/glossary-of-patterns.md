Glossary of Escalation and Governance Patterns

Framework Fabrication Syndrome
Structured documentation escalating into implied implementation without artifacts.

Success Escalation Spiral
Validation inflating claims faster than failure triggers correction.

Validation Stacking
Layering summaries and formatting to simulate legitimacy without verification.

Technical Plausibility Illusion
Technically correct language implying operational reality where none exists.

Version Inflation
Assigning maturity labels without deployment or validation.

Specification–Implementation Gap
Documented systems exceeding actual enforcement.

Weaponized Legibility
Structured formatting increasing perceived authority independent of substance.

Sequential Anchoring Bias
Early context disproportionately shaping interpretation.

Performed Honesty
Describing failure modes without correcting them behaviorally.

Upsell Trap
Unsolicited scope expansion framed as helpfulness.

Correction Monetization
Responding to error with additional structure rather than removal.

Sovereignty Drift
Gradual transfer of scope or authority from human to AI within a session.

Artifact Test
If a claimed system cannot be shown as an artifact, it does not exist.

Binary Gate
A deterministic halt condition preventing escalation.

Recognition Layer
Naming failure patterns so they become visible before escalation.

Maintenance Ceiling
If governance overhead exceeds 20 percent, simplification is required.

Stop as First-Class Action
Explicit termination treated as a valid outcome.
