# Translation Layer Model

In human–AI collaboration, two distinct cognitive layers must be separated:

1. Constraint Architecture (AI-facing)
   - Binary gates
   - Enforcement logic
   - Failure detection

2. Pattern Preservation (Human-facing)
   - Meaning continuity
   - Voice integrity
   - Boundary articulation

High-quality collaboration requires a translation loop between these layers.

Governance failures often occur when constraint design replaces pattern preservation, or when pattern preservation ignores constraint mechanics.

This case study documents the need for both.
