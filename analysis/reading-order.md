# Reading Order

This repository sits within a broader ecosystem of related work.

For clarity, the recommended reading sequence is:

1. Origin Event (this repository → /origin/)
2. Frozen Kernel (deterministic supervisory architecture)
3. Behavioral Differentiation (this repository → /experiments/)
4. Refusal Boundary documentation
5. Adult Mode Safety Ledger
6. Therapy Mode Safety Checklist
7. AI Collaboration Field Guide

The narrative artifact (“Lefty of the Briny Deep”) should be read as experimental substrate, not as the primary argument.

The primary argument concerns:
- escalation under probabilistic generation
- governance intervention
- dimensional authorship
