I remembered. Finally.

And for anyone collaborating with AI tools:
Stay human.
The tools are seductive.
Your sovereignty is precious.
Finish your work before you theorize about your process.

And make tea for someone.

## ABOUT THE TALLER SHELL TRILOGY

Before the meta-work, the actual work:

The Taller Shell Trilogy is a marine fantasy in three parts, written over three weeks through human-AI collaboration, exploring themes of mercy, grief, and what we build from broken things. (55,000 words total)

**Book I: The Taller Shell**
When a retired octopus sheriff is forced to testify against the mollusk who killed his partner, he must choose between justice and mercy—knowing his choice will doom an entire species to extinction.

**Book II: The Museum of Broken Things**
A young crab named Fernando discovers that broken things aren’t worthless—they’re the building blocks of something new. A story about salvage, mercy, and tea served through bars.

**Book III: The Calcifier’s Choice**
In a world where survival requires hardening, the soft things stage a quiet revolution. About grief, rigidity, and what it costs to stay flexible in a hardening world.

What follows is the story of how these books got made—including the part where the author got lost in mythology and had to find his way home.
