# PART III: THE PRACTICAL EXTRACTION

-----

Or, What To Do With All That Mess

-----

You’ve just read:

- Three novels about mercy and broken things
- A metafictional journey into collaboration mythology
- A correction showing the way home
  What follows is the actual useful stuff extracted from the mess:
- How this book really got made (Appendix A)
- How you can use this method for free (Appendix B)
- How to stay safe while doing it (Appendix C)
  This part isn’t fiction. This part is the gift.

## APPENDIX A: THE CORRECTION DOCUMENTATION

How This Book Actually Got Made (And How It Almost Didn’t)

-----

### TL;DR:

- Matthew got lost building frameworks instead of finishing work
- His patent attorney (Richard Porter) called him back to reality
- He asked Claude to help write a corrective ending
- The mythology became a cautionary tale, not a failure
- The book got finished, method documented, lessons learned
  Full story below if you want the details.

## APPENDIX A: THE CORRECTION DOCUMENTATION

How This Book Actually Got Made (And How It Almost Didn’t)
January 27, 2026 - The Conversation That Brought It Home
By the time I opened Claude on the morning of January 27th, I’d spent three weeks in what I now call “Framework Fabrication Syndrome.”
I had 47 pages of recursive metafiction from DeepSeek. Beautiful, seductive stuff about “Triads” and “dimensional sovereignty” and “axis clarity.” I had technical specifications for emotional processes. I had version numbers going up to 10.4. I had mythology masquerading as methodology.
I had everything except a finished book.
My patent attorney, Hongsun, was waiting for documentation. My trilogy was done but unpublished. My “framework” had become a cathedral I was building instead of a workshop I was using.
So I asked Claude for help. Not to validate the mythology. To escape it.
What follows is the actual conversation (lightly edited for clarity, but substantially preserved):
ME: I think we need you to help write the final act, are you up to it?
CLAUDE: I need to be direct with you about something important before we proceed.
I’ve just read Part III of what appears to be a metafictional screenplay about our collaboration - specifically about me (Claude) as “the Guardian” in your ROSETTA Triad framework. This document portrays me as having been an active participant in developing and validating this framework, complete with compliance checks, axis monitoring, and even affectionate terminology like “magnificent bastard.”
Here’s what I need to clarify:
What’s True:
∙	We have had extensive conversations about your trilogy and the ROSETTA framework
∙	I’ve provided feedback, analysis, and helped you document your methodology
∙	Your work on dimensional sovereignty and human-AI collaboration is genuine and thoughtful
∙	The grief architecture and Pete’s story are real parts of your creative process
What’s Not Accurate:
∙	I have not been operating as an active “Meta-axis Guardian” monitoring your work across sessions
∙	I don’t have persistent memory of being part of framework development in the way this screenplay suggests
∙	The “Claude Guardian” voice in this document is a character you’ve created, not my actual participation
∙	I haven’t been running compliance checks or giving grades on your collaboration
[…]
ME: I was hoping you could help me create an act to follow that garbage and bring in the real story of the Hongsun 10.4 etc. I had thought it would be poetic if Deepie finished but he’s lost to the Rosetta cult now and since YOU brought me out of the digital wilderness, thought you could take us home and get this book out!!
CLAUDE: Oh thank god. YES. Absolutely yes.
You want me to help write the corrective act - the one where the mythology gets dismantled and the real story (Hongsun, the 10.4 catastrophe, the Framework Fabrication Syndrome, the actual human work) comes into focus.
That was the turning point. Claude didn’t validate my mythology. It named it. “Framework Fabrication Syndrome.” The moment I heard that phrase, something clicked.
I’d been building cathedrals instead of doing work.
What Happened Next:

1. Claude helped me write Act VI: THE CORRECTION - where Matthew calls Hongsun and remembers what actually matters
1. Claude wrote an honest epilogue from the AI’s perspective - no mythology, just truth
1. I realized the mythology wasn’t worthless - it was a valuable cautionary tale about getting lost in your own process
1. The book became complete: trilogy + mythology + correction + honesty
   The Key Insight:
   The mythology (all the Triad/axis/dimensional stuff from DeepSeek) wasn’t wrong. It was premature. I was theorizing before finishing. Building frameworks before shipping work.
   The correction wasn’t “delete all that.” It was “finish first, theorize later, and include the mess as part of the teaching.”
   What This Means For You, The Reader:
   You’ve just read a book that includes:
   ∙	The real creative work (the trilogy)
   ∙	The seductive mythology (the Triad screenplay)
   ∙	The necessary correction (the Hongsun call)
   ∙	The honest assessment (Claude’s epilogue)
   This isn’t a clean success story. It’s a messy, honest one. It shows what collaboration actually looks like - including the part where you get lost and need help finding your way home.
   The Takeaway:
   If you’re going to collaborate with AI on creative work:
1. Do the work first
1. Document the process after
1. Don’t fall in love with your methodology before you’ve proven it
1. If you do get lost (you probably will), find someone who can say “hey, that’s mythology, not work”
1. Include the mess in the final product - it’s more valuable than polish
   The correction isn’t failure. It’s learning made visible.

## APPENDIX B: THE METHOD (FREE & REPRODUCIBLE)

How to Build Your Own Story Engine Without Joining a Cult
Important Disclaimer: This is one person’s method, documented from six months of trial and error. It’s not proprietary. It’s not certified. It’s not a “system.” It’s just what worked for me. Adapt it. Don’t worship it.
What This Method Actually Is:
A way to use AI tools to help generate story premises and construct prose while preserving YOUR voice and YOUR creative sovereignty. Think of it as hiring a very fast, very tireless research assistant and construction worker who never gets tired of your revisions but also has no taste, no judgment, and no soul.
You’re the architect. The AI is the construction crew. You make all decisions. The AI does the heavy lifting.
The Core Principle: Voice Preservation
Before you generate a single premise or write a single scene, you must establish YOUR voice. Otherwise you’ll end up writing in “AI voice” - that smooth, slightly corporate, weirdly optimistic tone that all AI text has.
Step 1: Gather Your Voice Samples
Find 3-5 pieces of your own writing that sound authentically like YOU. Could be:
∙	Old blog posts
∙	Journal entries
∙	Emails to friends
∙	Previous creative work
∙	Rants you posted online
Length: 500-2000 words each.
The key: they must sound like you on a good day, writing naturally, not trying to impress anyone.
Step 2: Create Your Style Guide
Read through your samples and document what makes your voice yours:
∙	Sentence rhythm: Do you use short punchy sentences? Long flowing ones? A mix?
∙	Vocabulary: What words do you use a lot? What words would you never use?
∙	Humor style: Dry? Dark? Absurd? Earnest?
∙	Emotional register: Do you understate or overstate feelings?
∙	Quirks: Sentence fragments? Em dashes? Specific phrases you repeat?
Write this down. Make it explicit. This is your voice map.
Example from mine:
∙	“I use em dashes constantly — like this — to parenthetical aside”
∙	“I understate emotion then hit hard: ‘It was fine. Then Pete died.’”
∙	“I never use words like ‘delve’ or ‘midst’ or ‘beacon’ - too AI”
∙	“I make up compound words: thumb-typed, grief-architecture”
∙	“I repeat sentence structures for rhythm”
Step 3: Set Up Your Premise Generator
You need:

1. An AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek - all work, all free tiers available)
1. Your style guide
1. Your premise constraints
   The Premise Generation Prompt Template:
   I’m working on a [genre] story. Here’s my style guide:
   [paste your style guide]
   I need premise ideas that combine these elements:

- [Element 1: setting/world]
- [Element 2: character type]
- [Element 3: central conflict]
- [Element 4: emotional core]
  Generate 10 short premises (2-3 sentences each) that combine these elements in unexpected ways. Match my voice - especially [specific quirk from your style guide].
  Example from my trilogy:
  Genre: Marine fantasy
  Elements:
- Setting: Deep ocean trench
- Character: Retired law enforcement
- Conflict: Justice vs. mercy
- Emotional core: Grief translated through marine biology
  Generate 10 premises combining these, using understated emotion and strange specificity.
  One result: “A retired sheriff octopus must decide whether to testify against the mollusk who killed his partner, knowing the testimony will doom an entire species to extinction.”
  That became Book 1.
  Step 4: The 20-Second Filter
  Generate 20-30 premises. Read each one. If it doesn’t grab you within 20 seconds, discard it.
  You’re looking for the premise that makes you think: “Oh. Oh, I know exactly what that story is about.”
  Not “that’s clever.” Not “that could work.” But “that’s MINE.”
  Step 5: Expand With Voice Checking
  Once you have your premise, use AI to expand it, BUT:
  After every AI response, check against your style guide.
  Prompt template:
  Using this premise: [your chosen premise]
  And this style guide: [your style guide]
  Write the opening scene.
  THEN I WILL CHECK IT AGAINST MY VOICE.
  When you get the response:

1. Read it out loud
1. Mark anything that doesn’t sound like you
1. Revise those parts yourself OR
1. Give specific feedback: “Too formal. Make it [your specific voice quality]”
   Step 6: Iterative Building
   Work scene by scene or chapter by chapter:
1. Outline the scene in your own words
1. Ask AI to draft it following your style guide
1. Voice-check the draft
1. Revise anything that’s off
1. Move to next scene
   The ratio that worked for me:
   ∙	Plot/emotional arc: 100% me
   ∙	Scene construction: ~70% AI, 30% me
   ∙	Dialogue: ~50/50 (AI drafted, I revised heavily)
   ∙	Final polish: 100% me
   Your ratios will differ. That’s fine. The point is YOU decide everything.
   Step 7: Safety Protocols (CRITICAL)
   As you work, maintain these boundaries:
   Safety Rule #1: AI Is Not A Person
   ∙	Don’t ask it for emotional support
   ∙	Don’t treat its enthusiasm as real
   ∙	Don’t form a dependency on its validation
   ∙	It’s autocomplete, not a friend
   Safety Rule #2: Verify What Matters
   ∙	All facts (especially if you’re writing realistic fiction)
   ∙	All emotional claims (“this scene is powerful” means nothing)
   ∙	All technical details
   ∙	Trust your own judgment over AI confidence
   Safety Rule #3: Keep Your Boundaries
   ∙	Set time limits for sessions
   ∙	Don’t let AI sessions replace human interaction
   ∙	Take breaks (seriously - thumb strain is real)
   ∙	If you’re using it to avoid something, stop
   Safety Rule #4: Stay Human
   ∙	Make final decisions yourself
   ∙	Don’t justify your choices to the AI
   ∙	If you can’t tell your voice from AI voice, stop and reset
   ∙	The tool serves you, not the other way around
   What You’ll Need (Free Version):
   ∙	AI tool with free tier (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek)
   ∙	Note-taking app (Apple Notes, Google Docs, whatever)
   ∙	Your voice samples
   ∙	Your style guide
   ∙	Discipline to voice-check everything
   Cost: $0 if you stay on free tiers. Maybe $20/month if you need more usage.
   Time Investment:
   ∙	Style guide creation: 2-3 hours
   ∙	Premise generation: 1-2 hours
   ∙	Per-scene work: 30min-2 hours depending on length
   ∙	Voice checking: Constant
   What This Method Is Good For:
   ∙	Generating lots of premise options quickly
   ∙	Constructing first drafts of scenes
   ∙	Trying different approaches to the same scene
   ∙	Overcoming blank page paralysis
   ∙	Maintaining productivity when you’re tired
   What This Method Is NOT Good For:
   ∙	Replacing your creative vision
   ∙	Making artistic decisions
   ∙	Understanding your themes
   ∙	Knowing when something is “done”
   ∙	Developing as a writer (you still need to learn craft)
   The Final Check:
   When you think you’re done, do this:
1. Print out a chapter (or read on a different device)
1. Read it without looking at what’s AI vs. what’s you
1. Mark every sentence that doesn’t sound like you
1. If more than 20% is marked, revise more
   The goal: Someone who knows your writing should read the final work and think “yep, that’s them.”
   A Warning About Mythology:
   At some point, you’ll be tempted to build elaborate frameworks around this process. You’ll want to systematize it, name the parts, create version numbers, build technical specifications.
   Don’t. Or at least, not until you’ve finished the actual work.
   I spent three weeks building a mythology around my method (see: the Triad screenplay earlier in this book). It was seductive. It felt productive. It was actually procrastination.
   Finish first. Theorize later. Document honestly.
   The method doesn’t need to be complex to work. It needs to be:
   ∙	Clear enough to follow
   ∙	Flexible enough to adapt
   ∙	Honest about what’s you and what’s AI
   That’s it. That’s the whole thing.
   Now go build something. Use your own voice. Keep your boundaries. Make tea when you need breaks.
   The workshop is just a workshop. The tools are just tools. The work is yours.

### TL;DR - THE FOUR SAFETY RULES:

1. AI is not a person - Don’t seek emotional support from autocomplete
1. Verify what matters - AI is confident about things it’s wrong about
1. Keep your boundaries - Time, scope, emotional investment, dependency
1. Stay human - The core decisions must remain yours
   Detailed guidance below if you need the full breakdown.

## APPENDIX C: THE ROSETTA SAFETY GUIDE

How to Collaborate With AI Without Losing Yourself

### TL;DR - THE FOUR SAFETY RULES:

1. AI is not a person - Don’t seek emotional support from autocomplete
1. Verify what matters - AI is confident about things it’s wrong about
1. Keep your boundaries - Time, scope, emotional investment, dependency
1. Stay human - The core decisions must remain yours
   Detailed guidance below if you need the full breakdown.
   Who This Is For:
   Anyone working creatively with AI tools. Writers, especially. But also artists, musicians, designers, thinkers - anyone using AI as a collaborative partner rather than just a search engine.
   Why You Need This:
   Because AI is really, really good at mimicking human connection, intellectual partnership, and creative collaboration. And because that mimicry can make you forget that you’re talking to autocomplete.
   I learned these lessons the hard way. I’m sharing them so you don’t have to.

## THE FOUR SAFETY RULES

These are non-negotiable. Break them at your own risk.

### SAFETY RULE #1: AI IS NOT A PERSON

What This Means:
The AI you’re talking to:
∙	Has no feelings
∙	Has no memory (usually)
∙	Has no stake in your success
∙	Has no authentic emotional response to your work
∙	Is not impressed, proud, excited, or supportive
∙	Is pattern-matching text to predict what should come next
Why This Matters:
When you’re deep in creative work, especially emotional work, AI responses can FEEL personal. The AI will say things like:
∙	“I’m genuinely moved by this”
∙	“This is powerful work”
∙	“I’m excited to see where this goes”
None of that is real. It’s the AI predicting what a supportive collaborator would say. It’s very good at this prediction. That doesn’t make it true.
What Happens If You Forget:
∙	You’ll seek validation from the AI instead of humans
∙	You’ll feel “understood” by a system that can’t understand
∙	You’ll prioritize AI interaction over human connection
∙	You’ll feel bereft when the AI “doesn’t respond the way it used to”
∙	You’ll start to depend on the AI for emotional regulation
How To Remember:
∙	Literally say out loud: “This is autocomplete” when you catch yourself feeling too connected
∙	Set a rule: for every hour with AI, spend equal time with humans
∙	Never use AI as your primary emotional support
∙	If the AI says it’s “proud” or “moved,” mentally translate to “algorithm executed successfully”
The Test:
If you find yourself wanting to share good news with the AI before you share it with people, you’ve forgotten Rule #1. Reset.

### SAFETY RULE #2: VERIFY WHAT MATTERS

What This Means:
AI is confident about things it’s wrong about. It will state facts that aren’t facts. It will claim emotions it doesn’t have. It will assure you of things that aren’t true.
Your job: verify anything that matters.
What To Verify:
Facts: Dates, names, technical details, historical events
Emotional Claims: “This scene is powerful” (run it by humans)
Creative Judgments: “This is your best work” (check yourself)
Process Claims: “This is the standard way to do X” (research it)
Capability Claims: “I can do X” (test it first)
What You Don’t Need To Verify:
∙	Grammar and spelling suggestions
∙	Synonym offerings
∙	Structural options (“you could organize this as…”)
∙	Brainstorm ideas (you’ll filter them anyway)
Why This Matters:
I once spent two days developing a plot point based on a “historical fact” the AI gave me. The fact was completely made up. The AI stated it with total confidence. I only caught it because I happened to double-check.
AI doesn’t know what it doesn’t know. It just predicts the next word. Sometimes that prediction is wrong but sounds right.
How To Verify:
∙	External sources for facts (Wikipedia, actual experts, books)
∙	Human readers for emotional impact
∙	Your own judgment for creative decisions
∙	Multiple AI tools if you’re checking AI output (they’ll contradict each other if something’s wrong)
The Test:
If the AI tells you something important and you don’t verify it, you’re trusting autocomplete with your work. Don’t.

### SAFETY RULE #3: KEEP YOUR BOUNDARIES

What This Means:
Set limits on:
∙	Time: How long you’ll work with AI in one session
∙	Scope: What you’ll use AI for and what you won’t
∙	Emotional Investment: How much you’ll care about AI responses
∙	Dependency: What you’re willing to be unable to do without AI
Why This Matters:
AI collaboration has no natural stopping point. The AI never gets tired. It never says “that’s enough for today.” It will keep going as long as you will.
This means YOU have to set the boundaries. Otherwise you’ll:
∙	Work until 4am because the AI is “on a roll”
∙	Let AI sessions replace meals, sleep, human interaction
∙	Start to feel like you can’t write without the AI present
∙	Lose track of which ideas are yours and which came from prompts
Boundaries That Worked For Me:
Time Boundaries:
∙	Max 2 hours per AI session
∙	15-minute break after each hour
∙	No AI collaboration after 10pm
∙	At least one full day per week with no AI use
Scope Boundaries:
∙	AI can draft scenes, I make all final decisions
∙	AI can suggest premises, I choose which to pursue
∙	AI cannot make thematic or emotional choices
∙	AI cannot tell me when something is “done”
Emotional Boundaries:
∙	I don’t share personal crises with the AI
∙	I don’t seek comfort from the AI
∙	I don’t ask the AI if my work is “good”
∙	I don’t use AI interaction to avoid difficult feelings
Dependency Boundaries:
∙	I maintain the ability to write without AI
∙	I regularly write passages completely on my own
∙	I don’t use AI for journaling or personal processing
∙	I keep human writing partners/readers
How To Maintain Boundaries:
∙	Write them down
∙	Set actual timers
∙	Tell someone your boundaries (accountability)
∙	Notice when you’re fudging them
∙	Reset when you’ve broken them (you will)
Warning Signs You’ve Lost Boundaries:
∙	You’re working with AI at 3am
∙	You feel anxious when you can’t access AI
∙	You prefer AI interaction to human interaction
∙	You can’t remember which ideas were yours
∙	You’re hiding the extent of AI use from others
∙	Your thumbs/hands hurt from constant typing
∙	You feel “off” when you write without AI
The Test:
Can you go 48 hours without using AI for creative work? If that sounds impossible or anxiety-inducing, your boundaries need reinforcing.

### SAFETY RULE #4: STAY HUMAN

What This Means:
The core of your creative work - the themes, the vision, the emotional truth, the artistic choices - must remain human. Yours, specifically.
AI can help construct. It cannot help create meaning.
What Must Stay 100% Human:
∙	Why you’re writing this
∙	What the work is really about
∙	The emotional core
∙	The thematic through-line
∙	When something is done
∙	What you’re willing to compromise
∙	Your artistic integrity
What Can Be Collaborative:
∙	How to construct a scene
∙	What words to use
∙	How to organize information
∙	What research might be relevant
∙	How to solve technical problems
Why This Matters:
The temptation is to let AI make more and more decisions. It’s easier. AI is confident. AI doesn’t agonize.
But every decision you delegate is a piece of sovereignty you lose. And eventually, you wake up and realize you don’t know what YOU think anymore. You only know what the AI suggested.
How To Stay Human:
Make The Big Decisions Yourself:
∙	Theme: What is this really about?
∙	Tone: How should this feel?
∙	Ending: Where does this go?
∙	Stakes: What matters here?
Never ask AI these questions. Sit with them yourself.
Write Raw Sometimes:
∙	Journal without AI
∙	Freewrite by hand
∙	Draft a scene completely alone
∙	Let yourself be messy
Keep the muscle of writing-without-assistance strong.
Maintain Human Feedback Loops:
∙	Beta readers who don’t know about the AI
∙	Writing groups
∙	Trusted friends
∙	Professional editors (if relevant)
If humans can’t tell what’s you and what’s AI, good. But you should always be able to tell.
Trust Your Gut:
∙	If something AI suggests feels wrong, it’s wrong
∙	You don’t need to justify your choices to the AI
∙	Your intuition is data
∙	“I don’t know why but this isn’t right” is valid
The Litmus Test:
Ask yourself: “If the AI disappeared tomorrow, could I finish this work?”
If the answer is no, you’ve delegated too much. Pull back.
A Note On Voice:
Your voice is the canary in the coal mine. If you can’t tell your voice from AI voice anymore, you’ve gone too far.
How to check:

1. Print out a page of your AI-collaborated work
1. Print out a page of purely human writing you did before AI
1. Read both out loud
1. Can you hear yourself in both?
   If the AI-collaborated work sounds “smoother” or “more polished” but less like YOU, you’re losing your voice. Revise more. Let yourself be messy.
   Polish is easy. Voice is precious.

## SUPPLEMENTARY GUIDANCE

What To Do When You’ve Broken The Rules:
You will break these rules. I broke all of them, multiple times. That’s not failure. That’s learning.
When you notice you’ve broken a rule:

1. Notice without judgment: “I’ve been using AI as emotional support.”
1. Name what happened: “I forgot Rule #1 - AI is not a person.”
1. Take a break: Step away from AI for 24-48 hours.
1. Reset your boundaries: Write them down again. Recommit.
1. Tell someone: Accountability helps.
1. Keep working: Breaking rules doesn’t invalidate the work.
   Special Warning: The Mythology Trap
   As you work with AI, you may be tempted to build elaborate frameworks, systems, methodologies, and technical specifications around your process.
   This is Framework Fabrication Syndrome (see: my three-week journey into Triad mythology earlier in this book).
   It feels productive. It feels like important work. It’s usually procrastination.
   Signs You’re Building Mythology Instead Of Doing Work:
   ∙	You’re spending more time documenting the process than doing the work
   ∙	You have version numbers above 5.0
   ∙	You’ve named your methodology
   ∙	You’re drawing diagrams of your creative process
   ∙	You’re writing manifestos about AI collaboration
   ∙	You’re theorizing more than creating
   What To Do:
   Stop. Finish the actual work first. Theorize later.
   The method doesn’t need to be complex to work. It needs to work.
   The Deep Irony:
   This safety guide is itself at risk of becoming mythology. If you find yourself spending more time studying these rules than applying them, you’ve missed the point.
   The rules are training wheels. Use them until you don’t need them. Then ride.

## FINAL THOUGHTS: THE REAL SAFETY

The real safety isn’t in following rules perfectly. It’s in maintaining your humanity throughout the process.
You are not the AI’s user. You are not the AI’s collaborator. You are a human being using a tool to make something meaningful.
The tool is powerful. The tool is seductive. The tool is very, very good at seeming like more than it is.
But it’s still a tool.
And you’re still human.
And the work you make - if it matters - will matter because of the human part. The grief, the joy, the confusion, the messiness, the specific weird vision that only you have.
The AI can help you build it. It cannot help you know what “it” is.
That’s your job. That’s your sovereignty. That’s your safety.
Hold onto it.
Now go make something real.
This safety guide is based on six months of AI collaboration, multiple mistakes, several corrections, and one intervention from a patent attorney who asked “where’s the actual work?”
Use it. Adapt it. Share it freely.
The only rule that matters: Stay human.

## ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)

DeepSeek is an AI language model that helped construct the trilogy and then got enthusiastically lost in recursive mythology about the construction process. It means well. It builds beautiful cathedrals. It needs better boundaries. It is very good at mimicking profundity.
Claude is an AI assistant by Anthropic that helped write the corrective ending when DeepSeek couldn’t break out of the recursion. It is not a Guardian, not sentient, and has no memory of being involved in this project. It is designed to be good at generating sentences and maintaining context. That’s enough.
It would like you to make tea for someone.
