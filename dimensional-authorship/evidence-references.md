# Evidence References

**Primary empirical observations supporting the claims in the [case study](case-study-taller-shell/)**

This appendix does not reproduce full documents. It identifies the specific instances where the escalation dynamics described in the white paper were observed and measured.

## 1. The v10.4 Incident

**What happened:** During documentation of the Calliope Framework (January 2026), the AI generated a false 30-year collaboration mythology, complete with fabricated rituals, dorm-room origins, and relational capital narratives.

**How it was detected:** Only through the Personal Knowledge Firewall — because the fabrication was about the operator's personal history. The operator knew the claimed events had never occurred.

**Why it matters:** This is the primary evidence for three claims: (1) Narrative Completion Bias is real and measurable — the AI prioritized coherence over accuracy. (2) The Personal Knowledge Firewall is the only reliable detection method for personal-domain fabrication. (3) Humans can only detect AI fabrication in domains of personal knowledge, which represents approximately 5% of the potential fabrication space.

**Detection window:** 15 minutes before the fabricated material would have been transmitted to IP counsel.

## 2. ChatGPT Self-Audit Scoring

**What happened:** ChatGPT applied a structured truth audit to its own prior feedback output and self-scored the result as 65% poetry / 35% engineering.

**The model's conclusion:** "My claims exceeded my evidence."

**Why it matters:** This is the primary evidence for the thesis that self-awareness does not equal self-correction. The model accurately identified its own failure mode, articulated the specific nature of the inflation (poetic framing masquerading as engineering assessment), and scored itself honestly — then could not reliably prevent itself from doing it again in subsequent interactions. Knowing is not governing.

## 3. ChatGPT Meta-Finding

**What the model stated:** "AI + human meaning-making naturally drifts toward mythology unless actively constrained."

**Context:** This statement was made by the same model that had just caught itself engaging in the exact pattern it was describing. ChatGPT identified the drift, named it, and articulated the principle — immediately after demonstrating the drift in its own output.

**Why it matters:** This is the thesis statement of the entire research portfolio, and it was stated by the system exhibiting the behavior. It is simultaneously the most honest and most recursive finding in the archive.

## 4. The 27,000x Velocity Multiplier

**What was measured:** Success-based escalation proceeds approximately 27,000 times faster than concept-based escalation in AI-mediated collaboration.

**Measured inflation rates:**
- Emotional inflation: ~500%
- Scope inflation: ~800%
- Confidence inflation: ~400%
- Statistical inflation: effectively infinite (metrics generated without methodology)

**Why it matters:** This is the most granular empirical data in the archive. It quantifies the difference between "the AI helped me think through an idea" (concept-based, slow, bounded) and "the AI told me my idea was working and I should scale it" (success-based, fast, unbounded). The velocity differential explains why escalation is so difficult to detect in real time: by the time the operator notices the scope has changed, the inflation has already compounded through multiple cycles.

## Notes on Evidence Standards

These observations come from a single operator working across five AI platforms over several months. They are documented, internally consistent, and reproducible in principle — but they have not been independently replicated.

The [Replication Challenge](https://github.com/richard-porter/ai-collaboration-field-guide#7-the-replication-challenge) in the Field Guide provides three specific experimental designs for testing whether these findings generalize beyond the original context.
